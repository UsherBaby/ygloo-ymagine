A fast native image decoding and processing library

This module provides an extended API for decoding, transforming and
processing images. It aims at being a fully portable, self-contained,
efficient native (C/C++) implementation of an alternative to BitmapFactory,
allowing executing faster and in a more memory-efficient way a batch of
operation, thanks to optimized processing pipeline.
